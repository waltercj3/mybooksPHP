# mybooks
mybooks is a website intended to keep a list of all the books one has read.  This version is a PHP/MySQL project designed for only a single user.  As one can imagine the actual data entry is prohibitively time consuming.  There are websites that will provide all the data from an ISBN number, but thus far I have not gotten around the cross-site-scripting issues.  If that is solved, then ISBNs could be read into the interface with a bar code reader.  
In no way do I claim that this is a fully functional version of this idea.
